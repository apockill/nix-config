# Installation
Everything in this set up is likely not "Strictly Correct (TM)", since it's my first time playing with NixOS.

## Steps

Clone the repository and symlink nix configuration
```shell
git clone git@github.com:apockill/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
```

To switch:
```shell
just switch
```

To update packages, use
```shell
just update
```

Next, it's probably a good idea to make sure your firmware is up to date. You can do
this via `gnome-firmware`, or:
```shell
just update-firmware
```

Finally, it's time to handle "Non-Nix State". This includes a few pipx packages, and a 
local set of python tooling I use, stored under `./tools/. 
There's not really a good way to manage python executables that aren't on the nixpkgs, 
so just run this command once:

```bash
just install-pipx-deps
```

## GPU Profiles

If your hardware/*/ configuration configures `system76-power`, 
you can switch graphics profiles via:

- GPU Disabled: `system76-power graphics integrated`
- Everything on integrated, GPU On: `system76-power graphics compute`
  
  **WARNING**: For whatever reason, this can cause docker containers running CUDA to not 
               find libcuda.so. Don't ask me why.
- Everything on GPU: `system76-power graphics nvidia`

You may see `org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.Failed` errors, but it seems that profile 
switching still works regardless of the error.

# Development Tips

I typically use Nix for my personal system, and distrobox+(poetry/other language specific
package managers) to containerize all of my projects.

Upon creating a system, I run the following to create all of my usual distroboxes:
```shell
just build-ubuntu-box
```

Then I validate the distrobox tests work, hardware passthrough works, and X passthrough
works by running:
```shell
just test-ubuntu-box
```
